# Criminal Justice Hub User Stories Repository
<p>User stories describe a user and the reason why they need to use the Criminal Justice Hub.</p>
<p>You must use user stories when building the Criminal Justice Hub - they&rsquo;re essential to building and running a service that meets user needs.</p>
<p>We should make sure every member of the team writes user stories and uses them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>track everything they need to do</li>
<li>think about their work from a user&rsquo;s perspective</li>
<li>discuss their work with colleagues</li>
<li>prioritise their work</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-write-a-user-story">How to write a user story</h2>
<h3 id="what-to-include">What to include</h3>
<p>Your user stories should include enough information for the product managers to decide how important the story is. They should always include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the person using the service (the actor)</li>
<li>what the user needs the service for (the narrative)</li>
<li>why the user needs it (the goal)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-right-format-for-user-stories">The right format for user stories</h3>
<p>They&rsquo;re usually written in the format:</p>
<p>As a&hellip; [who is the user?]</p>
<p>I need/want/expect to&hellip; [what does the user want to do?]</p>
<p>So that&hellip; [why does the user want to do this?]</p>
<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Example:</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/info/register-to-vote">Register to vote service&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;user story is &lsquo;as a UK resident, I want to get my details on the electoral register so that I can vote&rsquo;.</p>
</div>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to use this format but you should always briefly explain the actor, the narrative and the goal.</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-the-goal">Focus on the goal</h3>
<p>The most important part of a user story is the goal. This helps you:</p>
<ul>
<li>make sure you&rsquo;re solving the right problem</li>
<li>decide when the story is done and a user need is met</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling to write the goal then you should reconsider why you think you need that feature.</p>
<h3 id="acceptance-criteria">Acceptance criteria</h3>
<p>You can also include a few acceptance criteria for each story. Acceptance criteria are a list of outcomes that you use as a checklist to confirm that your service has done its job and is meeting that user need.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re often written as a list that begins with &lsquo;it&rsquo;s done when&hellip;&rsquo;.</p>
<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Example:</p>
<p>The acceptance criteria for the Register to vote service are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;it&rsquo;s done when the user knows how to register online&rsquo;</li>
<li>&lsquo;it&rsquo;s done when the user knows how to download a form to register by post&rsquo;</li>
<li>&lsquo;it&rsquo;s done when the user knows where to send the form&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Use the acceptance criteria to link to any evidence (for example spreadsheets or diagrams) that support the story.</p>
<h2 id="epics">Epics</h2>
<p>Large user stories (ones that would take more than a few weeks to develop and test) are typically called epics. If possible, split a large story or epic into smaller stories that can be completed within&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration" rel="external">an iteration.</a></p>
<h2 id="how-to-record-user-stories">How to record user stories</h2>
<p>Record each user story on a card and give it a title. The cards can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>be submitted as an issue and assigned to the relevent projects for review by the product management team.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="planning-with-your-user-stories">Planning with your user stories</h3>
<p>When you have a lot of stories, you might want to keep them in a seperate project and/or repository within GitHub as part of planning.</p>
<p>You should put all your stories in your backlog where your product manager will organise them in order of priority. They will then sit in the backlog until your team decides they are ready to work on them.</p>
<p>Your product manager and relevant team members can have a more in-depth discussion about the story when they&rsquo;re ready to start work on it. You should record more detail from these discussions in the user story.</p>
